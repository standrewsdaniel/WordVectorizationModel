# WordVectorizationModel Releases Page

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING:

Python Version 3.6+ must be installed.
1. Unzip the file to your desired file location.
2. Install required dependencies from the import statements at the top of the file.
	You can either accomplish this via IDE by clicking on the imports and installing them, or doing it via CLI. 
3. Compile the program and use it as you wish!


Run Options: 
You can delete certain category models in order to force the program to re train the models to gain different outputs. 
You can also modify the output by deleting the old model, and then adding new texts to the text file either in the all folder or in the desired category that you wish to modify.
Please note; Compile times will increase significantly upon changing and retraining the model.
